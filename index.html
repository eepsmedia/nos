            I have taken this set of apps down for maintenance.
            You can launch them, but they will not work properly.
            I am improving the security around the server.
            In the future, you will need some kind of ID (such as your Google ID) to host new universes.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm doing this now because no one has told me they are using these in classes
            before the end of 2020.
            And because use is so sporadic, I'm not rushing to get it done.
        </p>
        <p>
            BUT if I'm unaware of you and you really really want to use these apps,
            just let me know!
            I can re-open the last working version (which worked! Thanks, Florida International!)
            easily and quickly for a few days. eepsmedia at gmail dot com works fine.
